# Tomato Funkin' (DEMO)

Tomato Funkin' is a work-in-progress [Friday Night Funkin' v0.5.3](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) mod about the vtuber Dokibird; a ~~tomato~~ former phantom thief, now bounty hunter.

Made using Friday Night Funkin's Haxe polymod.

# How to compile

It is recommended to setup FunkinCompiler in this repo before starting the work.

https://github.com/FunkinCompiler/FunkinCompiler#how-to-install

But if you're not into that, running the "compiler.exe" and running either 'just-compile' or 'export' subprogram will give you a mod for testing.

# How to edit

Most of the mod's assets are in "mod_base"

The song files are in "fnfc_files"

The code of the mod is in "source/mod"
